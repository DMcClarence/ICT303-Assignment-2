So I've decided to train a model to perform binary classification on images that contain fire or no fire. I decided to do binary classification as it is something I am familiar with, allowing me to focus more on the process with finetuning without worrying too much about how to load and train the model.",

I added the sharpness augmentation to simulate the possibility of coming from low quality images, such as screenshots of CCTV footage or equivalent, allowing this to be applied in real world scenarios.",

So for the size of the dataset, it should require a smaller model. For this reason, I have decided to experiment around with some custom CNN architectures.",
