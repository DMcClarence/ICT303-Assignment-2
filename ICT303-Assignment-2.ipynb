I use ReLU as the activation function as it is the most commonly used activation function for modern neural networks. For the loss function, I have gone with torch's BCEWithLogitsLoss method. This method applies a Sigmoid activation to the outputs of the network and then calculates the Binary Cross Entropy Loss. According to torch's documentation, this is more stable than applying the Sigmoid manually and then calling BCELoss instead (https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss.html).",

The dataset I chose didn't come with pre-organised training, validation, and test sets, so I knew I would have to split them myself. Instinctively, I did this in the data loader load method using the random_split method from torch. However, as I thought more deeply about it, I realised that if I needed to reload the dataset to continue training further, or restart training from a previous checkpoint, there would be no guarantees that I would have the same split, potentially causing the model to train with the test data. My solution was to split the dataset manually because of the size not being too large.",
